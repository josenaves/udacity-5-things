# Project Idea

The app main goal is to teach 5 new things. In my case, my app will be teaching the 5 most important words in 
Brazilian Portuguese for first time travellers.

The target population for this app is all travellers that speaks English and want to know some words in 
Brazilian Portuguese. I think is very important for foreign travelling people to know and speak some words
in local language. 

This demonstrates that they respect and care about local culture and that 
they are striving to learn the local language too. It can open several doors (*really*).

For each word in Brazilian Portuguese, the app will teach the pronunciation and the word definition. The app also
allows them to share one word using social networks, emails, etc..
